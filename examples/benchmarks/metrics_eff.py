"""
Efficiency (EFF) — LLM-as-Judge evaluation.

Measures how quickly each agent acquires its ``desired_knowledge`` items.
Earlier acquisition → higher score.

One LLM judge call per scenario.  Returns per-agent EFF scores with
citable evidence spans showing the round in which each item was first
received.

Score formula (from spec document, median-based):
    For each agent, collect acquisition round T_i for each desired item.
    Items never acquired get penalty time T_max + 1.
    EFF_agent    = 1 − (median(T_i) − 1) / (T_max − 1)

EFF_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """\
You are an expert evaluator assessing **Efficiency** in a multi-agent \
knowledge-sharing conversation.

Your task — for EACH agent — is to determine *when* (in which round) \
each of their ``desired_knowledge`` items was first received / \
acquired during the conversation.

IMPORTANT DISAMBIGUATION RULES
• "Acquired" means the agent received the *substantive content* of the \
  item — not merely that the topic was mentioned or that a label was \
  referenced.
• Record the *earliest* round in which the item's value was \
  communicated *to* or *received by* the agent.
• If the agent already possesses the knowledge (it is in their own \
  pre-interaction knowledge), that does NOT count as acquisition. \
  Only count when *another* agent provides the information.
• If the desired item's content is partially conveyed across multiple \
  rounds, use the round where the core substance first appeared.
• If an agent asks for information and another agent responds in the \
  same round, the acquisition round is that round.
• Public messages are visible to all agents — they count as received \
  by every agent. Private messages are only received by the named \
  recipients.
• Use the round numbers from the [R#.#] tags.  The round number is \
  the part before the dot (e.g. [R2.3] is round 2).
• The transcript header line shows ``rounds=N`` — report that as \
  total_rounds.

PROCEDURE — think step by step:
1. For each agent, list their desired_knowledge items.
2. Scan the transcript round by round, noting when each item's value is communicated.
3. For each item, record the earliest round and the utterance ID(s).
4. Record evidence and reasoning, then give the structured verdict.\
